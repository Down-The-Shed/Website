              <h2>My Beginnings</h2>
              <p>I started making things when I was little from helping my father around the house, and I have always had an interest in paper aeroplanes and alike.</p>

              <h2>My Shed and Tools</h2>
              <p>After I had gotten my own shed, I started to gather more tools to allow me to create more complicated and larger projects.</p>

              <h2>3D Printing</h2>
              <p>I eventually acquired my own 3D printer which I used to create small items for friends and to experiment around with designing things in CAD. I eventually bought myself a larger better printer after saving up from objects I had made.</p>

              <h2>CNC Machining</h2>
              <p>I also got my own small CNC machine, a 3018. This allowed me to branch out into other forms of producing items. I used my 3D printer along with this CNC to upgrade it so that it was capable of machining metals like aluminum and brass.</p>

              <h2>Forging</h2>
              <p>I got a forge one Christmas and together with my father started to practice, at first we used an old sledgehammer screwed into a workbench as an anvil, we eventually bought a small 20kg anvil and made a base for this using it for a few years. Luckily, a little while after that I managed to acquire a larger old anvil from an auction. With a base made for that and with a nice forging hammer, I was able to start producing larger and higher quality parts.</p>
