            <!-- This is some very long text that is used as a placeholder to see if the scroll bar will show up when really long text is displayed in the I frame, this is to see if i need to somehow make word wrapping work or if i can get away with just making sure that the page will fit into the I frame, there is also the issue of the border around it that i need to get rid of. It seems that as long as it isnt the same word then it wraps nicely however the I frame changes size when the side nav opens and it squishes the page rather than pushing it to the side which i do not like so now i need to fix this issue. -->
